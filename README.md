Gift List is a website that allows users to create a list of items that can be shared with others via an alphanumeric code in a way that other users can purchase items for the original user with out notifying them while also updating the list for non-original users to prevent double purchasing a gift.

Lists and codes are stored in an PostgreSQL database, which is queried to provide different data based on if the user uses the owner code or shared code.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
